    <h2>About Me<h2>
      <p>
        I am a curious mind with a liking for good music.
      </p>
      <p>I finished high school in 2018 and decided to take 
        two gap years just to figure out what I wanted to do with
        my life.
      </p>
      <p>From my early days in high school I have always been awestruck
        by technological invetions especially mobile applications.
      </p>
      <p>It is in light of this that I decided to take a course 
        in programming.
      </p>

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>  
    <p>During my freetime I enjoy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Morning walks</li>
      <li>Cycling</li>
      <li>Listening to house music</li>
    </ul>

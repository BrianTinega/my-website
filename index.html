    <h1>About Me<h1>
      <p>
        I am a curious mind with a liking for good music.
      
      I finished high school in 2018 and decided to take 
        two gap years just to figure out what I wanted to do with
        my life.
      
      From my early days in high school I have always been awestruck
        by technological invetions especially mobile applications.
      
      It is in light of this that I decided to take a course 
        in programming.
      </p>
